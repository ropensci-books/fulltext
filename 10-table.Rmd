# Summarize articles on disk {#on-disk}

The `ft_table()` function makes it easy to create a data.frame of the text of PDF, plain text, and XML files, together with DOIs/IDs for each article. It's similar to the `readtext::readtext()` function, but is much more specific to just this package.

With the output of `ft_table()` you can go directly into a text-mining package like `quanteda`.

## Usage {#ft_table-usage}


```{r}
library(fulltext)
```

Use `ft_table()` to pull out text from all articles.

```{r}
ft_table()
```

You can pull out just text from XML files

```{r}
ft_table(type = "xml")
```

You can pull out just text from PDF files

```{r}
ft_table(type = "pdf")
```

You can pull out XML but not extract the text. So you'll get XML strings
that you can parse yourself with xpath/css selectors/etc.

```{r}
ft_table(xml_extract_text = FALSE)
```
